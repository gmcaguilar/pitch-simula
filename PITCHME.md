### Problem

- 1950s: Describing how a system works was usually done using flow diagrams and a list of rules. |
- 1957: Nygaard wanted a better way of doing this. |
- Nygaard saw the potential with computer-aided simulations |
- He wanted to standardize the procedures of simulating a system using a computer language. |
- However, he needed someone more skilled in programming..
